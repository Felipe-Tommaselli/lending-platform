## Project Overview
This project, developed for the final assignment of **SSC0958 - Criptomoedas e Blockchain**, combines blockchain technology and AI for a more efficient and secure financial lending process. It enables loan approvals based on AI-powered credit risk evaluations.

## Features
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates loan agreements on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- **AI Integration**: Uses machine learning models to evaluate credit risks.

## Technologies
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (tested locally with Ganache).
- **Programming Languages**: Python (for AI) and Solidity (for Smart Contracts).
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn (AI modeling) and Web3.py (blockchain interaction).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Deploy the Smart Contracts using Remix IDE or similar tools.
3. Run the AI scripts to integrate credit risk analysis.
4. Test locally with Ganache for a seamless development environment.
